tests:
    Pages should be fast enough:
        path: /.*
        assertions:
            - main.wall_time < 400ms
            - main.io < 150ms
            - main.cpu_time < 300ms
    Pages should not consume too much memory:
        path: /.*
        assertions:
            - main.memory < 50M
            - main.peak_memory < 75M
    Pages should not do too many SQL queries:
        path: /.*
        assertions:
            - metrics.sql.queries.count <= 12
    Pages should be light:
        path: /.*
        assertions:
            - metrics.output.network_out < 100KB
    Pages should not become slower:
        path: /.*
        assertions:
            - percent(main.wall_time) < 40%
            - diff(metrics.sql.queries.count) < 2
